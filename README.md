# API Design Workshop

intro to api design first and OpenAPI, using OpenAPI at all the phases of your lifecycle including contract testing and simplifying server side code, spectral to make an api style guide so your APIs become eventually consistent whether they’re built yet or not. Then leaving the OpenAPI stuff alone a bit there’s how to make APIs awesome through evolution and depredations, standards that make life easy, all sorts.

## 11:00 - 12:00 - Lets Talk About Anything

Open session around problems being faced there, and lets see if we can come up with any ideas. 

Whiteboard might be handy, depending on what comes up!

### First Challenge

Teacher API - Split up in smaller teams and let each team design one microservice.

Each team will define endpoints, bare minimum entities and relations between entities.

**Tool Suggestions**
  
- [Apicur Studio](https://www.apicur.io/studio/) - Web-Based and open-source.
- [Stoplight Studio](https://stoplight.io/studio) - Web-based is free for one user only. Desktop is free if you give them your email address.
- Various [text editors](https://openapi.tools/#text-editors) on openapi.tools.


### Second Challenge

Swap with another team and try to build some really simple API consumer code to interact with a mock of the API. 

Suggestions
- Try multiple mock tools in the team
- Interact with the mock via curl or a simple HTTP client like Insomnia first
- Write code when you have a good HTTP client interaction

Create a list of constructive feedback, for sharing with the group.


## Third Challenge (Bonus Round)

Compile a list of feedback and make a written API style guide.
